# Strip Comments (4 kyu)

https://www.codewars.com/kata/51c8e37cee245da6b40000bd

Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

### Example:

Given an input string of:

```
apples, pears # and bananas
grapes
bananas !apples
```

The output expected would be:

```
apples, pears
grapes
bananas
```
