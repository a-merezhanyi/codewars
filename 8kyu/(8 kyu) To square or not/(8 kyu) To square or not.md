# To square(root) or not to square(root) (8 kyu)

Write a method, that will get an integer array as parameter and will process every number from this array.

Return a new array with processing every number of the input-array like this:

If the number has an integer square root, take this, otherwise square the number.

**Example**

```
[4,3,9,7,2,1] -> [2,9,3,49,4,1]
```

**Notes**

The input array will always contain only positive numbers, and will never be empty or null.
